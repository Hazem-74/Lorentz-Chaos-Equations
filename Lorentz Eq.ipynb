# # __Lorentz Chaos equations__
# 

# The **Lorenz equations** are a system of three nonlinear ordinary differential equations that were originally derived by **Edward Lorenz** in 1963 as a simplified model for atmospheric convection. These equations are famous for being one of the first systems to exhibit **chaotic behavior**, meaning that small differences in initial conditions can lead to drastically different outcomes—a phenomenon popularly known as the **butterfly effect**.
# 
# ### Lorenz Equations (Standard Form):
# 
# $$
# \begin{aligned}
# \frac{dx}{dt} &= \sigma(y - x) \\
# \frac{dy}{dt} &= x(\rho - z) - y \\
# \frac{dz}{dt} &= xy - \beta z
# \end{aligned}
# $$
# 
# Where:
# 
# - $ x, y, z $: state variables  
#   - $ x $: proportional to the intensity of convective motion
#   - $ y $: related to temperature difference between ascending and descending fluid
#   - $ z $: proportional to the distortion from vertical temperature profile
# - $ \sigma $: Prandtl number (ratio of kinematic viscosity to thermal diffusivity)
# - $ \rho $: Rayleigh number (dimensionless parameter controlling convection)
# - $ \beta $: geometric factor
# 
# 
# ### Classic Parameter Values:
# 
# For chaotic behavior, Lorenz used these values:
# 
# - $ \sigma = 10 $
# - $ \rho = 28 $
# - $ \beta = \frac{8}{3} $
# 
# With these parameters, the system exhibits chaotic behavior for most initial conditions.
# 
# ### Key Features of Lorenz System:
# 
# - **Nonlinearity**: The terms like $ xz $ and $ xy $ make the system nonlinear.
# - **Dissipation**: Volume in phase space contracts over time (system is dissipative).
# - **Strange Attractor**: Trajectories settle onto a complex fractal structure called the **Lorenz attractor**.
# - **Sensitivity to Initial Conditions**: Small changes in starting points lead to widely divergent trajectories.
